# Concepts

Just as statistical concepts are the same, regardless of which software you use to analyze your data, the concepts in the field of geospatial science apply to any software you use. Here are a few resources for learning:

* [A Gentle Introduction to GIS](https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}
* [GIS fundamentals: a first text on geographic information systems by Paul Bolstad](https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/permalink/f/t3kr8e/01UCD_ALMA21327592230003126){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}

# Tools

There are many, many tools that perform geospatial analysis. Which tool is the right tool entirely depends on your goals, your needs, and your familiarity or desire to learn any particular tool. Listed here are a few of the tools commonly used on the UC Davis campus. There are many more. GIS Data Curator, Michele Tobias, is happy to discuss which option meets your needs.

## Desktop GIS & Remote Sensing

Desktop GIS programs have a graphical user interface and analysis processes are guided with forms that you can fill out with inputs, outputs, and necessary parameters.

### GRASS

GRASS can either be run as a standalone graphical user interface, you can access commands with a graphical user interface through QGIS, or it can be run from the command line. GRASS can be a powerful tool for network analysis, image processing, and other more complex processes.

## Commandline Libraries

### GDAL

GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) is a software library that translates between file formats. GDAL is the underlying code that allows you to save files in almost all digitial geospatial tools, however, you can also use it directly from the command line to convert files. A note on pronunciation: GDAL is pronounced either “Gee-Doll” or “Goo-Dull”, depending on who you ask.

|Platforms|Cost|Download|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Windows, Mac, & Linux|Free|[GDAL Homepage](https://gdal.org/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}|

If you have already downloaded another geospatial program (desktop GIS, spatial R packages, etc.), you probably already have GDAL installed, so please investigate that before you install another version as you could break your installations of other software.

Learning:

* [GDAL Tutorial Page](https://gdal.org/tutorials/index.html){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}

### PDAL

PDAL (Point Data Abstraction Library) is a software library for tanslating and manipulating point cloud data – most commonly we probably think of Lidar data, but PDAL deals with 3 dimensional point data in general. A note on pronunciation: Because the OSGeo maintains that there are two pronunciations of GDAL (see above), there are also two pronunciations of PDAL – “P-Doll” and “Poodle”. The second pronunciation is mainly used to be humorous.

### GRASS

See the Desktop GIS section above for more details. GRASS can also be used from the commandline. See the [GRASS and Shell](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS_and_Shell){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} page for examples and explanations.

## Web Mapping

Displaying data as an interactive online map can be a good option for sharing data and allowing viewers to explore data at multiple scales. Here are some options for creating interactive maps:

### Leaflet.js

[Project Homepage](https://leafletjs.com/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}

### QGIS2Web Plugin for QGIS

A graphical user interface in QGIS that writes html web map code in your choice of OpenLayers or Leaflet, QGIS2Web allows you to add and style layers as you would in QGIS to make a web map with no programming experience necessary.

[Project Homepage](https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/wiki){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}

## Photogrammetry & Photo Mosaic Stitching

Low altitude remote sensing platforms typically require many large scale (in the sense of map scale) images to cover a geographic area. To work with this kind of data, we need to stitch these photos together into one scene. Here are a few software options for doing this work.

[The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS)](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/board-on-geographic-names){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} is the official repository of the United States of America’s domestic geographic names data. The GNIS contains information about physical and cultural geographic features of all types in the United States, associated areas, and Antarctica, current and historical, but not including roads and highways. The database holds the Federally recognized name of each feature and defines the feature location by state, county, USGS topographic map, and geographic coordinates. Other attributes include names or spellings other than the official name, feature designations, feature classification, historical and descriptive information, and for some categories the geometric boundaries.
